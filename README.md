# Project Summary -

It entails gathering historical information on Bike rental rates, environmental conditions, and other pertinent elements. After preprocessing and cleaning the data, useful features are extracted from it. The prepared dataset is used to train a machine learning model, such as linear regression and decision trees. In order to improve the model's accuracy, methods like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are used to assess the model's performance. After being trained, the model may be used to forecast future demand for bike rentals based on inputs like weather and time. Insights from the research are intended to improve resource allocation and operational planning, resulting in a more effective and environmentally friendly transportation system in Seoul.

# Conclusion 

--> **Summer** was the season with the highest bike rental rates, followed by Autumn, Spring, and Winter. The busiest month for renting bikes is from **May to July**, and the least popular months are from December to February.

--> The working class makes up the vast majority of customers in the bike rental industry. The EDA analysis shows that in Seoul, the demand for bikes is higher during the weekdays while people are at work.

--> The best conditions are found in the **afternoon** from **4 to 8 pm**, when the **Humidity** is between **40% and 60%**
Major elements influencing the demand for rental bikes include temperature, daytime, solar radiation, humidity, and hour of the day.

--> The linear model's prediction was very low since there was a very weak linear relationship between the feature and the labels. With an accuracy of 0.904, a Gradient Boost model produces the best predictions, also the scores of XGBoost is nearly same as gradient boosting, 0.897.
