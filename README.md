# Project Summary -

It entails gathering historical information on Bike rental rates, environmental conditions, and other pertinent elements. After preprocessing and cleaning the data, useful features are extracted from it. The prepared dataset is used to train a machine learning model, such as linear regression and decision trees. In order to improve the model's accuracy, methods like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are used to assess the model's performance. After being trained, the model may be used to forecast future demand for bike rentals based on inputs like weather and time. Insights from the research are intended to improve resource allocation and operational planning, resulting in a more effective and environmentally friendly transportation system in Seoul.
